        "###  Final Recommendations\n",
        "Based on a thorough analysis of sales, competitor pricing, advertising impact, and operational factors, the following four data-driven recommendations are proposed for actionable improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1.  Target Price-Elastic Electronics to Capture Market Share\n",
        "Budget-friendly electronics like Bluetooth Headphones and Tablets consistently showed high sales, even with minimal price advantage over competitors. This indicates a strong customer response to small price differences in this segment.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Why It Matters:** Electronics are heavily comparison-shopped online. Even a slight price edge can shift customer decisions â€” potentially more than advertising.\n",
        "\n",
        " **What to Do:** Apply dynamic pricing strategies in the electronics category to undercut competitors selectively on high-demand items, especially in the low-price tier.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2.  Reallocate Ad Spend Based on ROI, Not Volume\n",
        "The analysis showed **no significant relationship** between Advertising Spend and Sales Volume. Surprisingly, low-spend products like Jeans and Coffee Filters often had higher sales than high-ad-spend items.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Why It Matters:** Simply increasing budget doesnâ€™t guarantee returns. Some products deliver higher sales efficiency per euro spent.\n",
        "\n",
        " **What to Do:** Shift focus to products with high `Ad_Efficiency`. Reallocate budget accordingly instead of increasing overall spend.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.  Stockouts Are Direct Revenue Blockers\n",
        "Products like the Luxury Jacket and Vacuum Cleaner went out of stock during peak demand, causing potential revenue loss.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Why It Matters:** Sales volume depends on availability. Stockouts during demand peaks indicate forecasting or supply chain gaps.\n",
        "\n",
        " **What to Do:** Leverage the `Is_Stockout` flag to build predictive inventory alerts. Pair this with weekly rolling sales data to avoid future gaps.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4.  Social Media Isnâ€™t a Reliable Sales Driver\n",
        "Despite the assumption that social buzz drives engagement, our data shows **very weak correlation** between Social Media Mentions and Sales Volume.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Why It Matters:** Social media seems more reflective of post-purchase activity than direct sales influence.\n",
        "\n",
        " **What to Do:** Shift marketing focus toward improving product reviews and ratings. These showed stronger connection to sales, especially in Clothing and Home Goods.\n",

        "This analysis explored how different product segments, pricing gaps, advertising effectiveness, and operational factors impact sales. Through data cleaning, feature engineering, and regression modeling, we extracted insights to guide strategic decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Electronics** had the highest total volume, driven largely by price-sensitive, low-tier products.\n",
        "- **Ad Spend** showed no direct correlation with sales; instead, review scores and price tier mattered more.\n",
        "- **Competitor pricing** did not consistently influence sales â€” brand trust sometimes outweighed cost.\n",
        "- **Operational blockers** like stockouts and low-rated but high-selling products revealed gaps in planning and customer perception.\n",

        "- Feature engineering (`Ad_Efficiency`, `Price_Tier`, `Price_Differential`, `Is_Stockout`)\n",
        "- EDA via seaborn/matplotlib\n",
        "- Correlation analysis and OLS regression\n",
