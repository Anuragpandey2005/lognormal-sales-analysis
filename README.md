# 📈 AI x Human: Lognormal Sales Analysis

This project analyzes sales data from an online retailer to uncover category trends, price sensitivity, and advertising effectiveness.

### 🔍 Objectives
- Segment influence on sales
- Competitor price impact
- Trend detection
- Extra drivers like reviews, weather, social buzz

### 🧠 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, seaborn, statsmodels)
- AI support via ChatGPT (documented below)
- Manual decisions on imputation, feature creation, modeling

### 🚀 Key Insights
- Price differential had minimal impact across categories
- Customer reviews matter more for premium products
- Ad spend does not strongly correlate with sales volume

### 🗂️ Files
- `notebooks/`: Main analysis
- `assets/`: Visuals for presentation
- `README.md`: You're reading it 😄

### 🤖 AI Collaboration
Used ChatGPT for:
- Brainstorming metrics (e.g., Ad Efficiency, Price Differential)
- Visual analysis ideas
- Sanity checks for modeling

Final decisions were made based on manual inspection of results and business reasoning.
