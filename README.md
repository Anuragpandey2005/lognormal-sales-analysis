# 📈 AI x Human: Lognormal Sales Analysis

This project analyzes sales data from an online retailer to uncover category trends, price sensitivity, and advertising effectiveness.

### 🔍 Objectives
- Segment influence on sales
- Competitor price impact
- Trend detection
- Extra drivers like reviews, weather, social buzz

### 🧠 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, seaborn, statsmodels)
- AI support via ChatGPT (documented below)
- Manual decisions on imputation, feature creation, modeling

### 🚀 Key Insights
- Price differential had minimal impact across categories
- Customer reviews matter more for premium products
- Ad spend does not strongly correlate with sales volume


### 🤖 AI Collaboration
Used ChatGPT for:
- Brainstorming metrics (e.g., Ad Efficiency, Price Differential)
- Visual analysis ideas
- Sanity checks for modeling

Final decisions were made based on manual inspection of results and business reasoning.

I followed a structured approach: cleaned the data, converted currencies, filled missing values, and created new features like ad efficiency and price differential. I analyzed trends using visualizations and regression. I found that while competitor pricing had limited direct impact, ad spend and product category played a more meaningful role. Finally, I proposed pricing strategies and ad budget allocation to improve performance.
